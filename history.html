            <h3>Ancient History</h3>
            <p>
                India's history and culture is dynamic, spanning back to the beginning of human 
                civilization. It begins with a mysterious culture along the Indus River and in farming
                communities in the southern lands of India. The history of India is punctuated by
                constant integration of migrating people with the diverse cultures that surround
                India. Available evidence suggests that the use of iron, copper and other metals 
                was widely prevalent in the Indian sub-continent at a fairly early period, which 
                is indicative of the progress that this part of the world had made. By the end 
                of the fourth millennium BC, India had emerged as a region of highly developed 
                civilization.
            </p>
            <h3>The Indus Valley Civilization</h3>
            <p>
                The History of India begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization, more precisely
                own as Harappan Civilization. It flourished around 2,500 BC, in the western part of South Asia,
                at today is Pakistan and Western India. The Indus Valley was home to the largest of the four 
                ancient urban civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India and China. Nothing was known about this
                civilization till 1920s when the Archaeological Department of India carried out excavations in
                the Indus valley wherein the ruins of the two old cities, viz. Mohenjodaro and Harappa were
                unearthed. The ruins of buildings and other things like household articles, weapons of war, 
                gold and silver ornaments, seals, toys, pottery wares, etc., show that some four to five thousand 
                years ago a highly developed Civilization flourished in this region.
                The Indus valley civilization was basically an urban civilization and the people lived in
                well-planned and well-built towns, which were also the centers for trade. The ruins of
                Mohenjodaro and Harappa show that these were magnificent merchant cities-well planned,
                scientifically laid, and well looked after. They had wide roads and a well-developed drainage
                system. The houses were made of baked bricks and had two or more storeys.
                The highly civilized Harappans knew the art of growing cereals, and wheat and barley constituted
                their staple food. They consumed vegetables and fruits and ate mutton, pork and eggs as well.
                Evidences also show that they wore cotton as well as woollen garments. By 1500 BC, the Harappan
                culture came to an end. Among various causes ascribed to the decay of Indus Valley Civilization
                are the recurrent floods and other natural causes like earthquake, etc.

            <h3>Vedic Civilization</h3>
            <p>
                The Vedic civilization is the earliest civilization in the history of ancient India.
                It is named after the Vedas, the early literature of the Hindu people. The Vedic Civilization
                flourished along the river Saraswati, in a region that now consists of the modern Indian states
                of Haryana and Punjab. Vedic is synonymous with Hinduism, which is another name for religious and
                spiritual thought that has evolved from the Vedas.
                The Ramayana and Mahabharata were the two great epics of this period.
            </p>
            <h3>The Buddhist Era</h3>
            <p>
                During the life time of Lord Gautam Buddha, sixteen great powers (Mahajanpadas) existed
                in the 7th and early 6th centuries BC. Among the more important republics were the Sakyas
                of Kapilavastu and the Licchavis of Vaishali.
            </p>
            <h3>Alexander's Invasion</h3>
            <p>
                In 326 BC, Alexander invaded India, after crossing the river Indus he advanced towards 
                Taxila. He then challenged king Porus , ruler of the kingdom between the rivers Jhelum 
                and Chenab. The Indians were defeated in the fierce battle, even though they fought with
                elephants, which the Macedonians had never before seen. Alexander captured Porus and,
                like the other local rulers he had defeated, allowed him to continue to govern his 
                territory.
            </p>
            <h3>Gupta Dynasty</h3>
            <p>
                After the Kushanas, the Guptas were the most important dynasty. The Gupta period has been
                described as the Golden Age of Indian history. The first famous king of the Gupta dynasty 
                as Ghatotkacha's son Chandragupta I. He married Kumaradevi, the daughter of the chief of
                the Licchavis. This marriage was a turning point in the life of Chandragupta I. He got 
                Pataliputra in dowry from the Lichhavis. From Pataliputra, he laid the foundation of his 
                empire and started conquering many neighbouring states with the help of the Licchavis. He 
                ruled over Magadha (Bihar), Prayaga and Saketa (east Uttar Pradesh). His kingdom extended 
                from the river Ganges to Allahabad. Chandragupta I also got the title of Maharajadhiraja 
                (King of Kings) and ruled for about fifteen years.
            </p>
            <h3>Harshavardhana</h3>
            <p>
                With the commencement of the 7th century, Harshavardhana (606-647 A.D.) ascended the 
                throne of Thaneshwar and Kannauj on the death of his brother, Rajyavardhana. By 612 
                Harshavardhana consolidated his kingdom in northern India.
                In 620 A.D. Harshavardhana invaded the Chalukya kingdom in the Deccan, which was then
                ruled by Pulakesin II. But the Chalukya resistance proved tough for Harshavardhana and 
                he was defeated. Harshavardhana is well known for his religious toleration, able 
                administration and diplomatic relations. He maintained diplomatic relations with China 
                and sent envoys, who exchanged ideas of the Chinese rulers and developed their knowledge 
                about each other.
            </p>
            <h3>Medieval History</h3>
            <p>
                For a period that has come to be so strongly associated with the Islamic influence and 
                rule in India, Medieval Indian history went for almost three whole centuries under the 
                so-called indigenous rulers, that included the Chalukyas, the Pallavas, the Pandyas, 
                the Rashtrakutas, the Muslims rulers and finally the Mughal Empire. The most important 
                dynasty to emerge in the middle of the 9th century was that of the Cholas.
            </p>
            <h3>The Palas</h3>
            <p>
                Between 8th and 10th centuries A.D., a number of powerful empires dominated the eastern 
                and northern parts of India. The Pala king Dharmpala, son of Gopala reigned from the late 
                8th century A.D. to early 9th century A.D. Nalanda University and Vikramashila University 
                were founded by Dharmpala.
            </p>
            <h3>The Senas</h3>
            <p>
                After the decline of the Palas, the Sena dynasty established its rule in Bengal. 
                The founder of the dynasty was Samantasena. The greatest ruler of the dynasty was 
                Vijaysena. He conquered the whole of Bengal and was succeeded by his son Ballalasena.
                 He reigned peacefully but kept his dominions intact. He was a great scholar and wrote 
                 four works including one on astronomy. The last ruler of this dynasty was Lakshamanasena 
                 under whose reign the Muslims invaded Bengal, and the empire fell.
            </p>
            <h3>The Pratihara</h3>
            <p>
                The greatest ruler of the Pratihara dynasty was Mihir Bhoja. He recovered Kanauj 
                (Kanyakubja) by 836, and it remained the capital of the Pratiharas for almost a century. 
                He built the city Bhojpal (Bhopal). Raja Bhoja and other valiant Gujara kings faced and 
                defeated many attacks of the Arabs from west.
                Between 915-918 A.D, Kanauj was attacked by a Rashtrakuta king, who devastated the city 
                leading to the weakening of the Pratihara Empire. In 1018, Kannauj then ruled by Rajyapala
                Pratihara was sacked by Mahmud of Ghazni. The empire broke into independent Rajput states.
            </p>
            <h3>The Rashtrakutas</h3>
            <p>
                This dynasty, which ruled from Karnataka, is illustrious for several reasons. 
                They ruled the territory vaster than that of any other dynasty. They were great patrons
                of art and literature. The encouragement that several Rashtrakuta kings provided to 
                education and literature is unique, and the religious tolerance exercised by them was 
                exemplary.
            </p>
            <h3>The Chola Empire of the South</h3>
            <p>
                It emerged in the middle of the 9th century A.D., covered a large part of Indian peninsula,
                as well as parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives Islands.
                The first important ruler to emerge from the dynasty was Rajaraja Chola I and his son 
                and successor Rajendra Chola. Rajaraja carried forward the annexation policy of his father. 
                He led armed expedition to distant lands of Bengal, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.
                The successors of Rajendra I, Rajadhiraj and Rajendra II were brave rulers who fought fiercely 
                against the later Chalukya kings, but could not check the decline of Chola Empire. The later 
                Chola kings were weak and incompetent rulers. The Chola Empire thus lingered on for another
                century and a half, and finally came to an end with the invasion of Malik Kafur in the early 
                14th century A.D.
            </p>
            <h3>The Rise of Islam in South-Asia</h3>
            <p>
                The initial entry of Islam into South Asia came in the first century after the 
                death of the Prophet Muhammad. The Umayyad caliph in Damascus sent an expedition 
                to Baluchistan and Sindh in 711 led by Muhammad bin Qasim. He captured Sindh and 
                Multan. Three hundred years after his death Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, the ferocious 
                leader, led a series of raids against Rajput kingdoms and rich Hindu temples, and 
                established a base in Punjab for future incursions. In 1024, the Sultan set out
                on his last famous expedition to the southern coast of Kathiawar along the Arabian Sea,
                where he sacked the city of Somnath and its renowned Hindu temple.
            </p>
            <h3>Timur's Invasion</h3>
            <p>
                It was during the reign of the last king of the Tughlaq dynasty that the mighty king 
                Timur or Tamerlane invaded India in 1398 A.D. He crossed Indus and captured Multan, 
                and just walked over to Delhi without much resistance.
            </p>
            <h3>Vijayanagar Empire</h3>
            <p>
                When Muhammad Tughlaq was losing his power in Deccan, the two Hindu princes, Harihar
                and Bukka founded an independent kingdom in the region between the river Krishna and 
                Tungabhadra in 1336. They soon established their sway over the entire territory between 
                the rivers Krishna in the north and Cauveri in the south. The rising powers of the Vijayanagar 
                empire brought it into clash with many powers and they frequently fought wars with the Bahmani 
                kingdom.
            </p>
            <h3>Bhakti Movement</h3>
            <p>
                An important landmark in the cultural history of medieval India was the silent revolution 
                in society brought about by a galaxy of socio-religious reformers, a revolution known as 
                the Bhakti Movement. This movement was responsible for many rites and rituals associated 
                with the worship of God by Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs of Indian subcontinent. For example, 
                Kirtan at a Hindu Temple, Qawaali at a Dargah (by Muslims), and singing of Gurbani at a 
                Gurdwara are all derived from the Bhakti movement of medieval India (800-1700). The leader 
                of this Hindu revivalist movement was Shankaracharya, a great thinker and a distinguished 
                philosopher. And this movement was propounded by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Namadeva, Tukaram, 
                Jayadeva. The movement's major achievement was its abolition of idol worship.
            </p>
            <h3>The Mughal Empire</h3>
            <p>
                In India, the Mughal Empire was one of the greatest empires ever. The Mughal Empire 
                ruled hundreds of millions of people. India became united under one rule, and had very 
                prosperous cultural and political years during the Mughal rule. There were many Muslim 
                and Hindu kingdoms split all throughout India until the founders of the Mughal Empire came. 
                There were some men such as Babar, grandson to the Great Asian conqueror Tamerlane and
                the conqueror Genghis Khan from the northern region of Ganges, river valley, who decided 
                to take over Khyber, and eventually, all of India.
            </p>
            <h3>Rise of the Sikh Power</h3>
            <p>
                Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak Dev at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
                Guru Nanak was born on April 15, 1469 in the Western Punjab village of Talwandi. 
                Even as a child, he was given to deep thinking with no interest in worldly life. 
                At the age of thirty, he got enlightenment. Thereafter, he travelled almost the 
                whole of the country and went over to Mecca and Baghdad, preaching his message.
                On his death he was followed by nine other Gurus in succession.
